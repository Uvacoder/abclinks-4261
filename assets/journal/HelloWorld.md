# Hello World! 
> May the JAM spark curiosity at first sight!

`Dev Log: Friday May 1st, 2020`

Hello World! I'm using JAMStack for (specifically) journal entries now! This journal entry content is built in markdown, populates vue component and served on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)!


_What is JAMstack? - you might ask..._
It's JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. Any project that relies on a tight coupling between client and server is not built with the Jamstack This page is not built witha server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace!
You might be surprised that the content management system (CMS) is completely headless.

Reasons why:
- this is super easy to setup
- highly responsive
- API first (I can integrate this later with other things!)

note to myself: 
1. explore [JAMStack Best Practices](https://jamstack.org/best-practices/).
2. think of creative ways to use APIs with this personal portfolio site
